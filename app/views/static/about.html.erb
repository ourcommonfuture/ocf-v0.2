				<h2>Our mission is to help students build skills needed in the world of tomorrow and a sense of global responsibility. <br />
				We want to accomplish this by (1) blending barriers between students and teachers (2) grounding our curriculum in publically available resources and (3) encouraging students to apply their knowledge in their local environments.</h2>

			<p class="right_msg">OCF is a social enterprise which offers online courses to high school students from across the globe. We started off by looking at courses that are normally not part of high school curriculum, namely sustainable development and human rights.</p>

		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p class="right_msg">Young people across the globe are itching to make a difference. Therefore our classes don’t stop at offering a theoretical perspective on the subjects thought, but guide students in the process of launching their own initiatives.</p>

			<h1>OUR EDUCATION APPROACH</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
			<p class="right_msg">Our courses are taught based on flexible curriculum that favors skills that are crucial in our society: teamwork, creativity, independence and adaptability. We want to inform our teaching with the knowledge that key facts are accessible with technology. We want to focus learning around how to access and analyse all available information, and we want to help the students understand bias embedded in data. We want to help students challenge the unknown, embrace complexity, and accept failure as a stepping stone. We want the students to know how to ask and answer complex questions, understand the cause of things, find solutions, work in a team and share their ideas. We want to encourage our course participants to identify their own interests and grow as independent thinkers. We want to make our students comfortable working in complex international/intercultural settings. Finally, we are interested in showing the students how to apply their understanding of complex issues to solve simpler, smaller, local problems.</p>

						<p >I like combining things - like the power of the web and the force of the United World Colleges mission statement to build a more sustainable and peaceful world. I have always been passionate about both education and business. I have a bachelors in political science (my thesis was on politics of higher education) and masters in finance.  I worked in a school as a teacher: art, English, photojournalism, business studies - you name it, I have likely taught it. During my business career, I have worked in corporate banking, financial and strategic analysis, but also in business development and consulting for start ups.</p>
